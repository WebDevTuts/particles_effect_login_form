# [Create Particle Effects With Particle.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK3cgD09Qf0)

In this project, we explore how to use particle.js that gives particle effects that typically is set in background. We will build a login form for the foreground and then have particle effect as our background. As we hover over the background, we will have the response that particles move out of the way. Also, when we click on the background, it will respond by creating more particles.
